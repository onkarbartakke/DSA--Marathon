In object-oriented programming, coupling refers to the degree of dependency between classes or modules. It describes how closely classes are connected and how much they rely on each other. There are two types of coupling: loose coupling and tight coupling.

Loose Coupling:
Loose coupling aims to minimize the dependency between classes or modules. In a loosely coupled system, 
classes interact with each other through well-defined interfaces or abstractions, rather than directly relying on concrete 
implementations.

Here's an example:

            class Car {
            private:
                Engine* engine;

            public:
                Car(Engine* engine) {
                    this->engine = engine;
                }

                void start() {
                    engine->turnOn();
                }
            };

            class Engine {
            public:
                void turnOn() {
                    // Start the engine
                }
            };

            int main() {
                Engine* engine = new Engine();
                Car* car = new Car(engine);

                car->start();

                delete car;
                delete engine;

                return 0;
            }


In this example, the Car class depends on the Engine class through an interface (Engine*). 
The Car class is loosely coupled with the Engine class because it relies on the abstraction of the Engine rather than directly 
depending on a specific implementation. This allows for flexibility and easy swapping of different engine implementations.

Pros of Loose Coupling:

Enhanced flexibility: Changes to one class/module are less likely to impact others, making the system more adaptable to modifications.
Improved maintainability: Classes can be modified or replaced without affecting the entire system.
Ease of testing: It is easier to isolate and test individual classes or modules.
Cons of Loose Coupling:

Additional complexity: Implementing loose coupling may require introducing interfaces or abstractions, adding some 
complexity to the codebase.
Overuse can lead to excessive indirection: If taken to the extreme, excessive levels of abstraction can make the code 
harder to understand and maintain.
Tight Coupling:
Tight coupling, on the other hand, indicates a strong dependency between classes or modules. In a tightly coupled system, 
classes directly depend on concrete implementations of other classes.

 Here's an example:

        class Car {
        private:
            Engine engine;

        public:
            Car() {
                // Car tightly depends on a specific Engine implementation
            }

            void start() {
                engine.turnOn();
            }
        };

        class Engine {
        public:
            void turnOn() {
                // Start the engine
            }
        };








In object-oriented programming, coupling refers to the degree of interdependence between different modules or components of a software system. It describes how closely one component relies on or is connected to another. There are two main types of coupling: loose coupling and tight coupling.

1. Loose Coupling:
Loose coupling refers to designing components that have minimal dependencies on each other. It promotes modular and independent code, where changes in one component have minimal impact on other components. Here's an example:

```cpp
class Car {
  Engine* engine;

public:
  void setEngine(Engine* eng) {
    engine = eng;
  }

  void start() {
    engine->start();
    // Other car start logic...
  }
};

class Engine {
public:
  void start() {
    // Engine start logic...
  }
};

int main() {
  Engine myEngine;
  Car myCar;
  myCar.setEngine(&myEngine);
  myCar.start();
}
```

In this example, the `Car` class depends on the `Engine` class, but it uses loose coupling by depending on the `Engine` through an abstract interface (`Engine*`). The `Car` class is not tightly bound to a specific implementation of the engine and can easily switch to a different engine implementation by setting a different instance of `Engine` using `setEngine()`. This loose coupling allows for flexibility and modifiability.

Pros of Loose Coupling:
- Increased flexibility: Components can be easily modified, replaced, or extended without affecting other parts of the system.
- Improved testability: Isolated components can be tested independently, facilitating unit testing and mocking.
- Better maintainability: Changes in one component have minimal impact on other components, making the system easier to maintain and debug.

Cons of Loose Coupling:
- Indirect communication: Loose coupling often involves additional layers of abstraction or interfaces, which can slightly impact performance.
- Complexity: Designing and managing loosely coupled systems can be more complex compared to tightly coupled systems.

2. Tight Coupling:
Tight coupling occurs when components are highly dependent on each other and rely on specific details of their implementation. Here's an example:

```cpp
class Car {
  Engine engine;

public:
  void start() {
    engine.start();
    // Other car start logic...
  }
};

class Engine {
public:
  void start() {
    // Engine start logic...
  }
};

int main() {
  Car myCar;
  myCar.start();
}
```

In this example, the `Car` class is tightly coupled to the `Engine` class. It directly creates an instance of `Engine` and relies on its specific implementation. Any change in the `Engine` class or the need to switch to a different engine would require modifying the `Car` class directly.

Pros of Tight Coupling:
- Simplicity: In some cases, tight coupling can simplify code by directly accessing and manipulating objects.
- Performance: Direct access can sometimes be faster since there are no additional layers of abstraction.

Cons of Tight Coupling:
- Decreased flexibility: Modifying one component can cause ripple effects and require changes in other tightly coupled components.
- Reduced maintainability: Code is more difficult to maintain, as changes can have unintended consequences in other parts of the system.
- Difficult testing: Tightly coupled components are harder to isolate and test individually, leading to more complex testing scenarios.

In general, it is recommended to strive for loose coupling in software design to improve flexibility, modifiability, and maintainability. However, there may be cases where tight coupling is acceptable or even necessary for performance optimization or simplicity.
